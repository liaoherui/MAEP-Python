MAEP(Metagenomics Assebly Evaluation Pipeline)
==============

### Abstract
MAEP is a new version of LAEP and can be used to evaluate the assembly quality of metagenomics 
data(especially from the different sequencing platforms and different assembly strategies)
**However,MAEP can only run on KMBGI's server.It will be updated and be developed to a software.**
